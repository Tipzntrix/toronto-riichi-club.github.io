## Before the tournament

- Make all necessary payments as early as possible.
- Plan your trip. Check for potential road closures and alternative routes to the venue.
- Practice personal hygiene (shower, brush teeth, deodorant, etc.).
- Arrive on time or slightly earlier.

## During the tournament
- Listen to and follow all directions given out by the staff.
- Put your phones to silent and remove any smartwatches.
- Arrive at your assigned table on time.
- Be respectful to everything: staff, players, equipment, venue, etc.
- After your game is done, move to the assigned waiting location, being aware of other tables that may still be playing.
- Go to the washroom between hanchan.

## During games

### Starting

- Splitting the dead wall is allowed, but discouraged. If it is split, wait until the third row of discards.
- During the opening draw, flip the dora and lower the rinshan tile at the start of the draw to prevent the rinshan tile from being knocked over.
- All players should ensure that everyone has drawn all their tiles. The dealer should wait until everyone has had a chance to look at their hand before discarding the first tile to allow everyone an equal chance to call.

### Playing

- Play at a reasonable speed.
- Keep discards orderly in rows of six.
- Keep talking to a minimum. Only calls, scoring and clarifications should be said at the table.
- When making calls, try not to be disruptive.
- Draw and discard with only one hand. Do not switch hands during gameplay.
- Keep your drawn tile separate from the rest of the hand. Do not incorporate it into your hand until you have discarded.
- Clearly enunciate calls.
- Place calls to the right of the hand.
- When making a concealed kan, make sure the tiles are revealed long enough to verify that it is valid.
- When discarding, ensure that all opponents can see the tile at the same time.
- Don’t touch other people's walls, points or tiles, unless you are drawing a tile or checking uradora.
- If a question or conflict, raise your hand, call for a referee and wait for a referee to arrive.

### Scores and winning

- If won by tsumo, show the winning tile and keep it separate from the rest of your hand.
- If won by ron, do not take the winning tile. Leave it in your opponent’s discard area.
- Don’t toss or throw the point sticks.
- Place your sticks on the table and not by hand so the amount can be verified by all players.
- Scores are public.

## After the tournament

- Thank your tournament organizers!
- Any cleanup help is highly appreciated!
